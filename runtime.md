RUNTIME COMPLEXITY

Describes the performance of an algorithm


going thru many problems with differents solutionsthis is anothwer way to investigate the best solution

we use it to compare wihich solutio is best for a give problem

a question o ask your self

how much more processing power/time is required to run your algorithm if we double the inputs?

example
the string reverse

int th first solution we only looped gonce for each additional character we had 1 step through a loop
we would call this the linear runtime becus ther is a one to one relationship


eg steps
as 'n' increased by one we had to do way, way more stuff, or (n*n) things total
this would be quadrtic runtime ...there was no one to one relationship
cas we had to do many things
