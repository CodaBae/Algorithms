RUNTIME COMPLEXITY

Describes the performance of an algorithm
going through many problems with different solutions this is another way to investigate the best solution
we use it to compare which solutions is best for a given problem
a question to ask yourself
how much more processing power/time is required to run your algorithm if we double the inputs?
example
the string reverse
in the second solution we only looped for each additional character we had 1 step through a loop
we would call this the linear runtime because there is a one to one relationship

Another example will be the steps
as 'n' increased by one we had to do way, way more stuff, or (n*n) things total
this would be quadratic runtime …there was no one to one relationship
cause we had to do many things
